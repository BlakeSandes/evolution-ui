title: "Spiral Text"
description:
  <p>Often on the hover state of a link or button, or even a small body of text, an effect is given to bring attention to the action. The spiralling of text is such an affect that could add a little flare to the hover state.</p>
  <p>The effect can be placed on either a <code>&lt;button></code> or <code>&lt;a></code> element as well as on any text surrounded by <code>&lt;span></code> tags. The element gets the <code>evo_c-spiralText</code> class for the effect to take place and each individual text is required to be wrapped by an <code>&lt;em></code> tag.</p>
