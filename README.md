- Each component gets its own sub-folder in the `components` folder.
- Add the scss partials of the components to the file named after you in the `partials` folder.
- Refer to `_jake.scss` for an example.
- Run `sass --watch components:css` to automatically compile scss.
- Use your named html file in the `html-temp` folder to write up your components.
- If you need fonts, Google Material icons have been added to each html file. (https://material.io/icons/ for usage instructions)
